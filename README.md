## How it works
This code shows a shopping example with a checkout calculating proper discount. The discount is based on the current sales action.

### No sales action
New customers pay full price, regular customers enjoy a 15% discount.

### Christmas Eve
On December 24th, every customer is granted 20% discount on the first product and 12.5% on the other products

### Black Friday
On Black Friday, things go crazy. Every customer is awarded a discount equal to the number of products in their basket, up to 80% off!
